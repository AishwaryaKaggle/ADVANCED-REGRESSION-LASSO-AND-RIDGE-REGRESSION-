## General Information
- Case study on  Surprise Housing  which deals with lasso and ridge regression to get efficient predictive variables without any nonlinearities in order to avoid the overfitting or underfitting of the model
- In this case study a model is build to analyse the predictive variables with lasso,ridge and also added the code of normal linear regression .So, that we can compare the outcomes of these three and can create efficient equation which can avoid any nonlinear implications.
- In Final Variables list   MSZoning_RL,GrLivArea,MSZoning_RM,OverallQual,TotalBsmtSF are the  most important features obtained by both lasso and ridge regression.
- The optimal Value of Lambda obtained for Lasso is 0.0003
- The optimal value for Ridge obtained is 50

## Technologies Used
- Python v3.7.2
- Numpy v1.20.1
- Pandas v1.2.4
- Seaborn v0.11.1
- Matplotlib v3.3.4
- statsModel library for doing statistical analysis
- sklearn library for doing statistical analysis

## Conclusions
- Final Lasso train value is 0.927 and test value is 0.886
- Final Ridge train value is 0.925 and test value is 0.886
- Final Lasso RSS train value 9.424 and test value is 6.624
- Final Ridge RSS train value 9.746 and test value is 6.848
- Final Equation is created using Lasso because Lasso values are obtained Slightly efficient than Ridge.
- The optimal Value of Lambda obtained for Lasso is 0.0003
- The optimal value for Ridge obtained is 50
